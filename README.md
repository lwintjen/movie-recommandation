# Movie Recommendation
This is a movie recommendation system using ML

How it works ?
It's a content based recommendation system, based on a movie that a user has seen and liked, we recommend him all the similar movies that he might also like.

What do you need ?
To run this script, you'll need scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, joblib and pandas. You'll find how to install scikit-learn, numpy and scipy on Scikit learn documentation : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
For pandas, everything is also explained on their documentation : https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html

Where does the data set come from ?
It comes from AMD movie data, it is a cleaned data set of 5000 movies (you don't need to reprocess that data).
